- Ok so let's try using [this paper](https://unanimous.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Artificial-Swarm-Intelligence-white-paper-1-21-19.pdf) as a starting point

- Ok wow this is pretty good already. We just have to avoid the puck getting lost

- Ok so the puck now stops on the option, but the physics simulation is still not perfect
    - I need to test it with multiple people

- Now let's host it on Vercel
    - I can't host on Vercel bc I need the team plan....
